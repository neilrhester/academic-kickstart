I research <b><i>intersectionality</i></b> in social cognition. Intersectionality describes how systems of oppression such as racism and sexism interlock to uniquely shape people's experiences of privilege and disadvantage. Although intersectionality's roots are philosophical and qualitative, it has lots to offer quantitative researchers for refining and expanding our theories of stereotyping, discrimination, and person perception to be more inclusive of non-WEIRD, non-White experiences. It can also help us rethink foundational assumptions in our field--for example, how we think about the basic link between stereotyping and discrimination.

My work mixes three quantitative approaches: experimentation, simulation, and big data analysis. I have published papers in various outlets, such as <i>The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Psychological Science,</i> and <i>Perspectives on Psychological Science.</i> In my spare time, I enjoy singing, playing/watching basketball, and writing music (I have an EP with a friend called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0uvxgVQmEKo3FpHdRjhN1I?si=NISzzj5nQ_WtViVCEpOLVQ&fbclid=IwAR1MbbgOn3OFGy6ReI_TlBSKGseazaGQIz351pFd9qAl7UsJ6cQgumMnl0o">Sunfall</a>).
