I research stereotyping and discrimination, person perception, and social cognition, with a focus on two specific topics. One emphasis for me is *intersectionality*, which describes the unique patterns of stereotyping and discrimination that emerge from having multiple identities (e.g., being a Black woman or a gay man). The other emphasis is on *decision models*, which describe exactly how cognitions (e.g., stereotypes) translate to behaviors (e.g., discrimination).

My work mixes three main quantitative approaches: experiments, big data analysis, and simulation. I have published papers in various outlets, such as *The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,* *Psychological Science,* and *Perspectives on Psychological Science*.
