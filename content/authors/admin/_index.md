Why is it that different people seem more or less attractive, trustworthy, competent, or threatening? My work investigates the myriad factors that explain how perceivers form impressions of targets. This work encompasses topics such as stereotyping and discrimination, social categorization, face perception, and perceptions of bodies and clothing. I also grapple with issues of measurement and causal inference in the domain of person perception.

My research engages with key theories and models in social psychology while also integrating critical ideas from outside of psychology (e.g., intersectionality theory). In my work, I use a combination of experimental methods, secondary analysis of large datasets, simulation, and mixed methods. I have published papers in various outlets, such as <i>The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Psychological Science,</i> and <i>Perspectives on Psychological Science.</i> In my spare time, I enjoy singing, playing/watching basketball, and writing music (I have an EP with a friend called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0uvxgVQmEKo3FpHdRjhN1I?si=NISzzj5nQ_WtViVCEpOLVQ&fbclid=IwAR1MbbgOn3OFGy6ReI_TlBSKGseazaGQIz351pFd9qAl7UsJ6cQgumMnl0o">Sunfall</a>).
