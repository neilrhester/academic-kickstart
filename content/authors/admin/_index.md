I research stereotyping and discrimination, person perception, and social cognition, with a focus on two specific topics. One emphasis for me is <b><i>intersectionality</i></b>, which describes the unique patterns of stereotyping and discrimination that emerge from having multiple identities (e.g., being a Black woman or a gay man). The other emphasis is on better understanding how cognitions (e.g., stereotypes) translate to behaviors (e.g., discrimination) using <b><i>threshold models</i></b>.

My work mixes three quantitative approaches: experimentatation, simulation, and big data analysis. I have published papers in various outlets, such as <i>The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Psychological Science,</i> and <i>Perspectives on Psychological Science.</i> In my spare time, I enjoy singing, playing/watching basketball, and writing music (I have an EP with a friend called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0uvxgVQmEKo3FpHdRjhN1I?si=NISzzj5nQ_WtViVCEpOLVQ&fbclid=IwAR1MbbgOn3OFGy6ReI_TlBSKGseazaGQIz351pFd9qAl7UsJ6cQgumMnl0o">Sunfall</a>).
